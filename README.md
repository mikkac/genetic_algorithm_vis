# Genetic Algorithm Visualization
Simple C++ & QML application which runs genetic algorithm and visualizes the results collected throughout the simulation. <br>

The algorithm is supposed to find maximum value of given function. Due to the lack of time, the function is fixed and it's simple parabola $x^2$ (called _estimation function_). <br>

Following results are plotted:
* Average value of estimation function in each simulation step
* Minimum value of estimation function in each simulation step
* Maximum value of estimation function in each simulation step
